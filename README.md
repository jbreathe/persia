# Persia

This project consists of a few subprojects.

## CDC

Small library to achieve the same functionality as Hibernate Interceptors, but in more portable way. 
It is not provider dependent, so you can use it with any JPA provider.

## Ext

Extensions for standard JPA API such as simple implementation of EntityManagerFactory.
